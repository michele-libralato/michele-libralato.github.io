excerpt: 'The purpose of this article is to present and validate a computationally efficient numerical approach for the calculation of the ground-coupled heat transfer in buildings with periodic boundary conditions. When the boundary conditions of the heat transfer problem are described by periodic functions, it is possible to consider the transient state problem as a quasi-stationary problem with considerable savings in terms of computational time. The method is presented in detail from a mathematical point of view, together with a validation for two simple cases of slab-on-grade thermal losses, four comparisons with the ISO 13370:2007 procedure, a case with a complex shape and an evaluation of the computational efficiency.'
